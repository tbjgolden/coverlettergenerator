<p>Hello,</p>
<hr />
<p>My name is Tom Golden and I am a recent graduate in a double major of Math and Computer Science at the University of Warwick, in England. I am looking for work in San Francisco Bay (by the way, I'm a permanent resident and have no working restrictions) and the software engineer position with you at AWT seems like a superb opportunity to learn more about maritime.</p>
<p>I moved to California to work in technology. My previous experience of software development was through an investment bank, Goldman Sachs, in London, but my long-term ambition has always been to move to the technology sector.</p>
<p>The languages that I'm best practiced with are JavaScript and also other front-end web work, and Java (which is what we used at Goldman). My web portfolio, http://goldenforever.github.io/, shows some of my front-end work, and some basic web applications in a couple of backends (PHP, Node). The university newspaper's website was nominated for a national design award.</p>
<p>Which leads me to AWT; a company which, in my research, has shown itself to have a great recent record and offers me an opportunity to show what I can do and learn in the process. I'm here because I work hard and I put in the hours and that's why I think I would be able to really contribute to the team. My full-time experience is limited but my diverse experiences and background will be a real asset.</p>
<p>So, indeed, I would like to put my name forward to become AWT's newest software engineer.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br />
Tom Golden</p>
