Hello,

-----------------

My name is Tom Golden and I am a recent graduate 
in a double major of Math and Computer Science at
the University of Warwick, in England. I am
looking for work in San Francisco Bay (by the way,
I'm a permanent resident and have no working 
restrictions) and the software engineer position with you
at AWT seems like a superb opportunity to
learn more about maritime.

I moved to California to work in technology. My
previous experience of software development was
through an investment bank, Goldman Sachs, in
London, but my long-term ambition has always been
to move to the technology sector.

The languages that I'm best practiced with are 
JavaScript and also other front-end web work,
and Java (which is what we used at Goldman). My
web portfolio, http://goldenforever.github.io/,
shows some of my front-end work, and some basic
web applications in a couple of backends (PHP,
Node). The university newspaper's website was
nominated for a national design award.

Which leads me to AWT; a company which, in my
research, has shown itself to have a great recent
record and offers me an opportunity to show what I
can do and learn in the process. I'm here because 
I work hard and I put in the hours and that's why
I think I would be able to really contribute to 
the team. My full-time experience is limited but
my diverse experiences and background will be a
real asset.

So, indeed, I would like to put my name forward to
become AWT's newest software engineer.

Best regards,  
Tom Golden
